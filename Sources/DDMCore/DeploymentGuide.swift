/// DDM Migrator's output is standard Apple declaration JSON — Type / Identifier
/// / Payload — so it isn't tied to any one MDM. But every MDM ingests custom
/// declarations differently (and some don't yet), so the guide spells out the
/// workflow per vendor and is honest about current limitations.
///
/// Two ingestion shapes matter:
///   • whole-file  — the vendor takes the full `.ddm.json` (e.g. Fleet).
///   • paste       — the vendor wants the declaration Type plus the *Payload
///                   object only*, and generates its own Identifier/ServerToken
///                   (e.g. Jamf Pro Blueprints → Custom Declarations).
